<P>  
Dry cleaning businesses, from the perspective of the customer, are either plants or drop shops.[6] A plant does on-site cleaning.[6] A drop shop receives garments from customers, sends them to a large plant, and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer.[6] The turnaround time is longer for a drop shop than for a local plant.[6] However, running a plant requires more work for the business owner.[6] Since 2010, in some markets, web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning.[6]

This cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry cleaning was carried out in two different machinesâ€”one for the cleaning process, and the second to remove the solvent from the garments.
